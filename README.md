Hi 👋 My name is Adeline
========================

Beginner Coder
--------------

I want to learn how to code in python, SQL, and R. 

I am documenting my programming journey, this time with the help of a course I am taking on Udemy called "100 days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp." So why am I learning how to code? Well there are a lot of reasons - and they all are selfish (as what learning does to you, in my opinion). 
1. I would love to design a webpage, or a blog, wouldn't that be cool? I like to write in my free time, and it would be awesome to have a website that showcases all my writings and other fun little hobbies I have.
2. Data. Data is becoming a huge thing in the world (for obvious reasons) and I would love to be a part of that. and honestly, when I was working in a scientific lab a few years back, i didn't really enjoy the lab work, but when it was time to analyze the data after an experiment?? oh i was all hands on deck. Honestly, I should have taken it as a sign to do a career change, but I'm stubborn, and I don't like crossing things off my list until i'm very sure that I'll never look back with regret.
3. the applicability of coding is awesome, and I now know after working for a few years that I absolutely need some bit of creativity or problem-solving in my day-to-day -- it definitely keeps my mind sharp, and I think coding can definitely push me to a career that will give that to me.
4. I have some ideas that would help my life, and honestly I need to learn how to code to make it happen!
